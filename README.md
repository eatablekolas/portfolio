# My Portfolio
A collection of projects I worked on as a software developer.



# Pixel Rogue
A simple rogue-like shooter/platformer game where you have to shoot your way through rooms filled with enemies. At the end of each level you pick an effect that will benefit both you, and the enemy, making the difficulty progressively harder.

# Nanaba
An unfinished project. The game would be about constructing robots to fight and scavenge for you. This is a demonstration of the robot commanding mechanic.

# North Pole
An unfinished project. In this game you would play as a polar bear in the north pole, hunting for food and fighting the local human population for it.

# Perlin Noise Generator
This was part of the North Pole project. We were planning to use this to generate levels for the game procedurally.

# Your friend's car breaks down in the middle of the woods
I was inspired to make this game after my car broke down in the middle of the woods while driving home from my friend's house. It was supposed to be a short horror game where you have to explore a mysterious wooden hut to find something to fix the car.
